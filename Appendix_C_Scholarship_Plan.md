# Scholarship Plan
###### Last updated Winter 2018

The purpose of this document is to outline the objectives of the scholarship chair.

### Scholarship Competition

At the start of each term, the scholarship chair must collect every member’s previous term’s grades. 
The scholarship chair will then assign the brothers into groups of roughly six members. 
These groups will compete against each other to see which group can get the highest group average for the current semester. 
The group with the highest average of the individual GPAs will receive a prize determined by the scholarship chair and executive committee.

### Study Hours and Study Halls

The scholarship chair and each executive member shall each host a two hour study session weekly.
Any interest member may also host study sessions as long as they are reported to the scholarship chair.
The session should be a productive workspace in either campus libraries or the chapter house.
It is the responsibility of the host to ensure study sessions are silent and no extraneous devices being used.
Members are encouraged to attend at least one session weekly.
If a member finds the study sessions unproductive for any reason, changes or alternatives can be made with the scholarship chair.

### Three-Strike Policy

Members will adhere to the Three Strike Policy, which will be carried forward by the scholarship chair. The policy outline is as follows:

1. Each member must meet the academic standard (GPA) outlined in the bylaws.
2. If a member does not meet this requirement during a semester while he is active, he will gain one (1) strike and meet with the Scholarship Chair to create an academic improvement plan.
3. A member gaining two (2) strikes must meet with the Scholarship Chair and President to discuss the offending member’s future in the fraternity and academics. This may result in the member being put on social probation.
4. Gaining a third (3) strike will require the offending member’s membership status to be reviewed by the Judicial Committee and Scholarship Chair shall recommend he become a suspended member until satisfactory academics are achieved.

The scholarship chair may choose to forgo handing out a strike if the the member achieves an average within two grade points of the academic standard or if the member had exceptional and irregular circumstances preventing them from achieving the academic standard. These decisions will be subject to approval from the executive committee. The Academic Improvement Plan may still be recommended in such cases.

### Academic Improvement Plan

Academic improvement plans are required by all members who received a strike, according to the three strikes policy, in the previous term. The scholarship chair may also request that members who were close to receiving a strike create an academic improvement plan. Plans are not restricted to these members and can be requested by any member who wants to improve their grades. These plans are made by the scholarship chair and the member and tailored to the member’s class schedule and program.
The plan may be administered by a member recommended by the scholarship chairman and appointed by the President.

The plan outlines the required amount of hours the member should be studying for each specific class. This includes the amount of time required for any assigned readings, assignments, and lab reports, in addition to time spent reviewing notes and practicing problems from the class. On average, the required time spent per class should be no less than two hours per week. In addition to outlining the amount of hours that the member should be putting into each class outside of lectures, seminars, or labs, the improvement plan will also include follow-up dates for the scholarship chair to check in on the member’s progress throughout the term. Normally, these would be following any groups of midterms or major papers that the member has. During these meetings the amount of hours is reviewed and may be increased for classes that the member is having trouble with. Decreasing hours should be discouraged as this may lead to the member achieving a lower performance in a class they are doing well in. At the end of the term the scholarship chair should also meet with the member and review the plan, including notes on the classes and the required amount of hours for future reference when creating other plans.
